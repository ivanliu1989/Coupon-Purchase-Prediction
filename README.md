# Coupon-Purchase-Prediction
Using past purchase and browsing behavior, this competition asks you to predict which coupons a customer will buy in a given period of time. The resulting models will be used to improve Ponpare's recommendation system, so they can make sure their customers don't miss out on their next favorite thing.
